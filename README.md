# Fix My Code Challenge

Welcome to my Fix My Code Challenge!

This project is all about jumping into broken codebases and fixing them — without rewriting everything from scratch.

The idea is to improve my debugging and problem-solving skills while working with code I may or may not be familiar with.

## 📚 Background
I’m working with a repository that contains broken implementations in different programming languages. My goal is to analyze, understand, and fix these issues.

## 📁 Repository Structure
I’m using the Fix_My_Code_Challenge repository as a base.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:hs-hq/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge.git
cd holbertonschool-Fix_My_Code_Challenge/challenge
```
